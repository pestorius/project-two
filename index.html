			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img class="main_dot" src="./dot.png" alt="Image of a dot">
			<p>Travelling from the other side of the globe, I have come a far way from Malaysia to 
			achieve my goals and explore new opportunities. I began my journey in Oakton Community 
			College, where I dived into the basics of Computer Science. 2 years later I've transferred 
			to Illinois Institute of Technology to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I 
			am currently a senior at Illinois Institute of Technology, and I've gained a vast knowledge 
			of techniques and practices in Computer Science and related fields.</p>

			<h1>What I've Done</h1>
			<img class="main_dot" src="./dot.png" alt="Image of a dot">
		    <h2><u>Summer of 2018</u></h2>
			<p>I've been spending most of my summer breaks in Malaysia since I began studying in the states.
			It's a great chance for me to unwind and be as lazy as I want, but I try to be productive as well.
			I use this free time to learn some new skills or use the skills I already have to build something.</p>
			<h3>Ukulele</h3>
			<p>Ukuleles are relatively easier to learn so I decided to dedicate some time from my summer
			to learn it. I spent around a month learning the basics of the ukulele, which involved learning
			how to tune, strum, and play some songs with the easier chords.<br>I learned all this from a 
			website that consisted of 3 easy-to-follow 
			<a href="https://willgrovewhite.com/learning-to-play-the-ukulele-lesson-one/" title="Link to lessons"
			target="_blank">lessons</a> composed by Will Grove White. I wouldn't say I'm amazing at playing the
			ukulele, but my knowledge for now is fairly basic.</p>
			<h3>Android Development</h3>
			<p>I took a course in android application development in the fall of 2017, and it helped me discover
			my love for software engineering. After that I've always wanted to create a simple app that I could
			build and publish on the Play Store. My dad suggested I create an app for his business, so I spent
			most of the summer building, publishing, and maintaining the app. It does not have many downloads
			because it's simply a neat looking catalogue, but it was a great way to practice my software development
			skills.</p>

			<h1>What I'm Up To</h1>
			<img class="main_dot" src="./dot.png" alt="Image of a dot">
		    <h2><u>Fall of 2018</u></h2>
			<p>During my semesters at Illinois Institute of Technology I don't have a great amount of free time
			to learn many new skills or practice existing ones, but this semester I'm working (possibly) with
			IIT's public safety department to improve and implement an app I worked on in my android app development
			class which I have written about in the <a href="#projects" title="Jump to project">projects</a>
			section. I have proposed the idea of the app to public safety and they seem to be interested but I would have to
			show improvement in the design and functionality before they can decide if they want to use the app.</p>

			<h1>What I Plan To Do</h1>
			<img class="main_dot" src="./dot.png" alt="Image of a dot">
		    <p>I was able to secure a job as a software engineer at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence in Malaysia for 
			when after I graduate. Although I'll be preoccupied with my job, I plan to keep on working on new skills 
			as an escape from what I do from 9 to 5.</p>
			<h3>App Development</h3>
			<p>I know, this isn't much of an escape because it is indeed software engineering, but for now it is a
			passion and as long as I have ideas for an app I'm going to have that urge to create. In fact, I might 
			have to continue developing and maintaining the IITSecurity app if needed. If IITSecurity gets the green
			light by Illinois Tech's Public Safety Department, I would have to work remotely with my team to develop
			the app for iOS as well.</p>
			<h3>More skills I plan to learn:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Solve the Rubik's Cube</li>
				<li>Basic violin</li>
				<li>Music editing</li>
				<li>Basic skateboarding</li>
				<li>3D drawing</li>
			</ul>

		    <h2><u>IITSecurity</u></h2>
			<p>IITSecurity is an Android mobile application I helped build with my two team mates
			Jose Casarrubios and Yael Torres in a mobile application development course. It aims 
			to improve security on campus by allowing students to call Public Safety at the push
			of a button, as well as view a map of previous incidents on a map to identify and avoid 
			danger zones. This app can be used by the Public Safety as well, allowing them to view 
			and respond to recent incidents, with the app providing them with the quickest route to
			a student in trouble.</p>

				<img id="panic_button" src="Picture1.png" alt="Screenshot of panic button">
				<img id="timer" src="Picture2.png" alt="Screenshot of Timer">
				<img id="map" src="Picture3.png" alt="Screenshot of Map">
			</figure>
			<p>The first three images are screenshots of the user interface for the student side
			of the application.</p>
			<p>The first image shows a large panic button, which appears as soon as a student
			opens the app, allowing them to quickly tap on the button when in an emergency, which 
			calls public safety. The victim's precise location is also sent to public safety, in
			case a student is unable to communicate during an emergency.</p>
			<p>Since accidental tapping of the button can occur, we have implemented a timer that
			waits five seconds before calling public safety, allowing students to cancel the call
			if needed, as shown in the second image.</p>
			<p>The third image displays another functionality for the student side of the application
			that allows users to view a map of where previous incidents have occurred. This could be 
			used to help a student plan a journey ahead of time, allowing them to avoid areas with
			higher crime potential. The pins on the map are color-coded, indicating the type of incident
			that occurred (robbery, assault, sexual assault, etc.).</p>
			<figure class="row_of_pics">
				<img id="recent_events" src="Picture5.png" alt="Screenshot of recent events">
				<img id="route" src="Picture6.png" alt="Screenshot of route">
				<img id="documented_events" src="Picture7.png" alt="Screenshot of documented events">
			</figure>
			<p>These next three images are screenshots of the user interface for the public safety
			side of the application.</p>
			<p>The first image shows the user the recent events that have occurred. These are events
			that have very recently occurring or are currently taking place. If an event was recently
			attended to with details of the crime known, public safety can input data about the incident
			by tapping the info circle on the right side of the event, which will shift the event from
			the recent events list to the documented events list. If it is an event that is taking place,
			public safety can quickly respond by tapping on the event, which brings them to the second image.</p>
			<p>The second screenshot shows up when the user has tapped on an event. They are then given
			the quickest route on Google Maps to the victim's location.</p>
			<p>The third image shows the documented events list, which are a list of events that have
			occurred in the past. These are the events that appear on the map in the student side of the
			application.</p>
			<p>This is a working application and not just a designed interface. The only functionality 
			it currently lacks from being a usable app is the ability to call the authorities when the 
			panic button is pressed</p>
