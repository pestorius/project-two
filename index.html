      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img class="main-dot" src="images/dot.png" alt="Image of a dot" />
      <p>Travelling from the other side of the globe, I have come a far way from Malaysia to 
      achieve my goals and explore new opportunities. I began my journey in Oakton Community 
      College, where I dived into the basics of Computer Science. 2 years later I've transferred 
      to Illinois Institute of Technology to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I 
      am currently a senior at Illinois Institute of Technology, and I've gained a vast knowledge 
      of techniques and practices in Computer Science and related fields.</p>

      <img class="main-dot" src="images/dot.png" alt="Image of a dot" />
        <h2><u>Fall of 2018</u></h2>
      <p>During my semesters at Illinois Institute of Technology I don't have a great amount of free time
      to learn many new skills or practice existing ones, but this semester I'm working (possibly) with
      IIT's public safety department to improve and implement an app I worked on in my android app development
      class which I have written about in the <a href="#projects" title="Jump to project">projects</a>
      section. Once I have graduated I plan on learning to do the following in my free time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Solve the Rubik's Cube</li>
        <li>Basic violin</li>
        <li>Music editing</li>
        <li>Basic skateboarding</li>
        <li>3D drawing</li>
      </ul>

        <h2><u>IITSecurity</u></h2>
      <p>IITSecurity is an Android mobile application I helped build with my two team mates
      Jose Casarrubios and Yael Torres in a mobile application development course. It aims 
      to improve security on campus by allowing students to call Public Safety at the push
      of a button, as well as view a map of previous incidents on a map to identify and avoid 
      danger zones. This app can be used by the Public Safety as well, allowing them to view 
      and respond to recent incidents, with the app providing them with the quickest route to
      a student in trouble.</p>
      <figure class="row-of-pics">
        <img id="panic-button" src="images/Picture1.png" alt="Screenshot of panic button" />
        <img id="timer" src="images/Picture2.png" alt="Screenshot of Timer" />
        <img id="map" src="images/Picture3.png" alt="Screenshot of Map" />
        <figcaption>The first three images are screenshots of the user interface for the student side
      of the application.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The first image shows a large panic button, which appears as soon as a student
      opens the app, allowing them to quickly tap on the button when in an emergency, which 
      calls public safety. The victim's precise location is also sent to public safety, in
      case a student is unable to communicate during an emergency.</p>
      <p>Since accidental tapping of the button can occur, we have implemented a timer that
      waits five seconds before calling public safety, allowing students to cancel the call
      if needed, as shown in the second image.</p>
      <p>The third image displays another functionality for the student side of the application
      that allows users to view a map of where previous incidents have occurred. This could be 
      used to help a student plan a journey ahead of time, allowing them to avoid areas with
      higher crime potential. The pins on the map are color-coded, indicating the type of incident
      that occurred (robbery, assault, sexual assault, etc.).</p>
      <figure class="row-of-pics">
        <img id="recent-events" src="images/Picture5.png" alt="Screenshot of recent events" />
        <img id="route" src="images/Picture6.png" alt="Screenshot of route" />
        <img id="documented-events" src="images/Picture7.png" alt="Screenshot of documented events" />
      <figcaption>These next three images are screenshots of the user interface for the public safety
        side of the application.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The first image shows the user the recent events that have occurred. These are events
      that have very recently occurring or are currently taking place. If an event was recently
      attended to with details of the crime known, public safety can input data about the incident
      by tapping the info circle on the right side of the event, which will shift the event from
      the recent events list to the documented events list. If it is an event that is taking place,
      public safety can quickly respond by tapping on the event, which brings them to the second image.</p>
      <p>The second screenshot shows up when the user has tapped on an event. They are then given
      the quickest route on Google Maps to the victim's location.</p>
      <p>The third image shows the documented events list, which are a list of events that have
      occurred in the past. These are the events that appear on the map in the student side of the
      application.</p>
      <p>This is a working application and not just a designed interface. The only functionality 
      it currently lacks from being a usable app is the ability to call the authorities when the 
      panic button is pressed</p>
